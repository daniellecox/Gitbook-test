# Experimenting with Gitbook:  

This Gitbook contains my notes on the course [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).

## What a gitbook can contain

### Some code

```python
# This program adds two numbers

num1 = 1.5
num2 = 6.3

# Add two numbers
sum = num1 + num2

# Display the sum
print('The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum))
```

## Some formula

$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x) dx
$$

Block math with (tag):

$$
\tag{a.1} x+y^{2x}
$$

Block math with tag:
$$
\tag{a.2} x+y^{2x}
$$
